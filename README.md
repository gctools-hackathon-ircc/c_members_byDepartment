Member by Department
====================
This module bins every member of GCconnex to their respective department then tabulates the information in a more readable format (such as in a table).
Another feature is that it will tag members with their respective departments for future developments of modules.

4. Use Cases


1. Module Dependencies
----------------------
- required to be after the groups module
- tested and implemented on an Elgg v1.8 platform
- tested and implemented with emails that contain the department (not with canada.gc.ca)


2. Installation Guide
----------------------
- must have 'gc_dept' directory within the data directory (chmod 777) with full read/write access
- within 'gc_dept' directory contains: 
	+ department-listing.csv (includes all valid departments)
	+ department-listing.json (includes all valid departments - autogenerated)
	+ department_directory.json (includes all users in resp. departments)
	+ all_departments.json (includes department and their information)
	+ department_directory-yyyymmddhhmmss.json (includes users with the department) is a backup
- if need to update:
	+ (A) backup department_directory.json and remove from the original directory then go to members/department page
	+ (B) daily cron job can be run
	+ (C) go to admin panel and click on 'regenerate report'


3. Future Development
---------------------
- this module does not actually tag the members (there seems to be inefficiencies with elgg's Libraries)
- this module keeps a record of all the departments for each member
- a way to check if user's icon have been updated (the library functions create a massive load on server Elgg v1.8)
- tagging members through the use of metadata (elgg's library is too slow to build this functionality)


4. Use Cases
-------------
- Covers the following cases
	+ add/remove member from site
	+ generating information for the first time
	+ sort information (discrepencies between lower case and upper case)
	+ add/remove colleague option
- Does not for the following cases:
	+ user updated avatar
	+ user updated display name
